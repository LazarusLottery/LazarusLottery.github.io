Hi I am the leader of the weekly lottery. There has been some newer members come to lazarus since the last time I recruited. If you want to be in the lottery post what building you want your winnings paid to, then leave the conversation. If you don't want to be in the lottery than you can leave the conversation.

The rules of the lottery are simple. Everyone has a building they want their winnings paid into if they win. Every week someones building is picked and everyone else has to pay 10FP into the building they picked.

So if you want to join, post what building you would want your winnings to go to. The new members will be part of next weeks lottery.
